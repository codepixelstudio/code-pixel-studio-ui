# codepixel.atom UI theme

[![forthebadge](http://forthebadge.com/images/badges/fuck-it-ship-it.svg)](http://forthebadge.com)

Code is nothing without pixels. This package makes your codepixels look nice.

The theme files style some elements of the Atom UI considered to be **_off-limits_** according to Atom's theme package best practices. Someday I'll remedy that, but until then, buyer beware.

Requires [codepixel.atom-syntax](https://github.com/codepixelstudio/codepixel.atom-syntax) to function properly.

This package is in very early development. Check back soon for updates. Or don't. What the fuck do I care.
